# SRB2OldPatcher
A simple CLI tool designed to make binary editing old versions of SRB2 easier.
## Building
All that's required is a copy of Make and GCC.
From there, just run the Makefile and it should build into the /bin/ directory.
## Running
Simply download the file called "SRB2OldPatcher-Windows.zip" if you're on Windows or "SRB2OldPatcher-Linux.zip" for Linux from https://github.com/HalfHaIf/SRB2OldPatcher/releases/ and run the file using your terminal.
